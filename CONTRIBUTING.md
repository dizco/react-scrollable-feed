## Development

Local development is broken into two parts (ideally using two tabs).

First, run rollup to watch your `src/` module and automatically recompile it into `dist/` whenever you make changes.

```bash
npm start # runs rollup with watch flag
```

The second part will be running the `example/` create-react-app that's linked to the local version of your module.

```bash
# (in another tab)
cd example
npm start # runs create-react-app dev server
```

Now, anytime you make a change to your library in `src/` or to the example app's `example/src`, `create-react-app` will live-reload your local dev server so you can iterate on your component in real-time.

#### Publishing to npm

```bash
npm publish
```

This builds `cjs` and `es` versions of your module to `dist/` and then publishes your module to `npm`.

Make sure that any npm modules you want as peer dependencies are properly marked as `peerDependencies` in `package.json`. The rollup config will automatically recognize them as peers and not try to bundle them in your module.


#### Deploying to Github Pages

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This creates a production build of the example `create-react-app` that showcases your library and then runs `gh-pages` to deploy the resulting bundle.
